# chill-breeze
module 6 weather forecast application

# Description

-This is a weather application I made with a weather API and JavaScript. 
When you type in any city, it is supposed to give you the weather forecast for the current day as well as the expected forecast over the next five days. 

-For the layout and base code, I watched a tutorial by Jonah Lawrence on Youtube (link will be in the credits section) to get started. I had additional assistance with a tuotr to get a "for loop" going, which showed to be probably the most challenging at the time.

-A couple issues I have not been able to resolve as of yet:

-The icon will not loop for all the forecast days except the first day.

-The forecast for the current day is supposed to show in box #1. The information is incorrect. The box is only generating the forecast for the following day and always matching box #2.

-I haven't been able to move my title and subtitle to the top of the page like I wanted to (aka "Chill Breeze" and "Check the forecast. We got you."). I assume it's an issue with the flexbox.

-I haven't figured out how to add a search history. The local storage is working, though.

# How to Run the Project
